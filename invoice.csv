(COI) for the unit cancellation riders is levied via cancellation of units directly from the Account Value. COI is automatically deducted on every
COI due date until the policy matures or there is insufficient Account Value. COI will continue to be deducted during non-payment of regular
premium of the policy. Unit cancellation rider COI will be deducted with your consent as per the declaration section in the application form.
